          <h2>Episode I</h2>
          <h1>A new code</h1>
          <p>
            A junior web developer starts his journey into the universe of
            coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hailing from a small distant planet of Coderine, our protagonist,
            born on a code farm, encounters an old hermit who will train him in
            the ways of coding. From HTML to CSS, Javascript and so much more.
          </p>
          <p>
            But he must beware of the dark web. Random youtube video's, facebook
            and tumblr, lurks around the corner, all leading to the ways of
            procrastination.
          </p>
          <p>
            He will have to steel his will and avoid all temptations should he
            wish to succeed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hoping to one day becoming a worthy full stack developer, he trains
            hard. And with some help from his peers, who knows what amazing web
            designs he may conjure one day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Young coder, you're our only hope..
